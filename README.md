## Variables

Variables are used to store data temporarily in computer memory.

### How to declare a variable?
Two ways:

#### Using var keyword
This was the method used prior to ES6. But it has it's own set of problems and usually avoided these days.

Eg: var name = 'Amar';

### Using let keyword
This is the preferred method since ES6.

Eg: let name = 'Amar';
